# Custom UX Toolkit - (CUT)

This is a project for building a standalone Web Component using Stencil.

## Stencil

Stencil is a compiler for building fast web apps using Web Components.

Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frontend frameworks into a compile-time rather than run-time tool. Stencil takes TypeScript, JSX, a tiny virtual DOM layer, efficient one-way data binding, an asynchronous rendering pipeline (similar to React Fiber), and lazy-loading out of the box, and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any browser supporting the Custom Elements v1 spec.

Stencil components are just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build off of the the design library with common UX standards and improve the library as much as possible.

# Must Have Guidelines:

## Naming Components

When creating new component tags, we recommend use `cut-wc` in the component name (ex: `<cut-wc-component-name>`).
